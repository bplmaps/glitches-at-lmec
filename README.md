# glitches-at-lmec

In July 2025, [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) wound down project hosting. This repository contains web apps built with and hosted on Glitch between 2021 and 2025. All projects were exported from Glitch with minimal to zero edits to the code. They now deploy to Netlify from this repository.
